# The travel planner app

## Overview
This app allows users to plan their travel routes. The app shows weather forecast for 1 week that includes the date of the depature. It is able to predict the weather only for the 16 days starting from the current date.
The app fetches data from "Weatherbit", "Geonames" and "Pixabay" API. I have built the app by vanilla JS, Webpack, Express, Jest and Service Workers.

## Usage
Just type the name of the city you want to visit. Then choose the date of departure and return. You can also delete a route with the button "Cancel".
