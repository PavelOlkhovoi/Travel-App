# The travel planner app

## Overview
This app allows users to plan their travel routes. The app shows current weather if the trip is within a week. If not, you can see the predicted forecast. We can predict the weather only for the nearest 16 days.
The app fetches data from "Weatherbit", "Geonames" and "Pixabay" API.
I have built the app by vanilla JS, Webpack, Express, Jest and Service Workers.

## Usage
Just put a link to an article and get the result with the following characteristics: "Agreement", "Subjectivity", "Confidence","Irony".
