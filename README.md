# The travel planner app

## Overview
This app allows users to plan their travel routes. The app shows current weather if the trip is within a week. If not, you can see the predicted forecast. We can predict the weather only for the nearest 16 days.
The app fetches data from "Weatherbit", "Geonames" and "Pixabay" API. I have built the app by vanilla JS, Webpack, Express, Jest and Service Workers.

## Usage
Just type the name of the city you want to visit. Then choose the date of departure and return. You can also delete a route with the button "Cancel".
